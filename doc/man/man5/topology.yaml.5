.SH "NAME"
topology.yaml \-  Slurm configuration file for the topology plugins

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.LP
\fBtopology.yaml\fR is a YAML\-formatted configuration file that defines
multiple network topologies for optimizing job resource allocation in Slurm.
The file must be located in the same directory as \fBslurm.conf\fR. Any text
following a "#" in this file is treated as a comment through the end of that
line.

Additional details are available in \fBtopology.conf\fR(5) and in the
Topology Guide: <https://slurm.schedmd.com/topology.html>

\fBNOTE\fR: Slurm will first check for topology.yaml.
If this file exists, topology.conf will be ignored.

.SH "PARAMETERS"

.LP
Each topology contains the following attributes:
.LP

.TP
\fBtopology\fR
Unique name of the topology, will be used to identify it on partition
configurations. Must be the first attribute.
.IP

.TP
\fBcluster_default\fR
The first topology defined with \fBcluster_default: true\fR will be used for
partitions without an explicitly specified topology and cluster-wide operations
not tied to a partition (e.g., slurmctld-to-slurmd communication). Defaults to
\fBfalse\fR.
.IP

.LP
Each topology must also define exactly one of the following topology types:
.RS
.TP
\fBblock\fR
This topology will use the \fBtopology/block\fR plugin. Must contain additional
fields, see below.
.IP

.TP
\fBflat\fR
If set to \fBtrue\fR, this topology will use the \fBtopology/flat\fR plugin
(default for most systems)
.IP

.TP
\fBtree\fR
This topology will use the \fBtopology/tree\fR plugin. Must contain additional
fields, see below.
.IP
.RE
